# Heaps 1

* Priority queue vs FIFO, FILO.
* Tree heap.
* Heapify up, heapify down.
* Depth of tree as related to number of elements.
    * Derivation of the max size of 32 bit number.
* Examples:
    * Priority Queue
    * Dijkstra's algorithm
    * Heapsort
    * kth min element
        * Can be done in O(k log n) if you build the heap in O(n) time.
        * Can do it in O(n log k) with a min heap of size k.
