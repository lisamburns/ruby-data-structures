# Topics

* Time Complexity
    * Amortized Time Complexity of DynArray push
* Dynamic Array
    * Memory, pointer arithmetic
* Hash Set
    * ArrayIntSet (`O(MAX_VAL)` memory)
    * IntHashSet (only ints)
    * Store by hash value
    * Hashing Passwords: Salting, Blowfish
* LinkedList, LRUCache
* BSTs; self-balancing tree
    * Balancing can't go wrong.
    * No O(n) worst case
    * In-order traversal
    * Let's say you have an itinerary. At any moment, you want to know
      the next thing to do. You also want to add new itinerary items
      at any time quickly.
