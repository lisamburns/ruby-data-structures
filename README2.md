# Topics

## Lec 1

* Time Complexity
* CatMatch
* Table of Time Complexities

## Lec 2-3

* Dynamic Array
* Memory, pointer arithmetic
* Amortized Time Complexity of DynArray push 

## Lec 3-4

* Hash Set
    * ArrayIntSet (`O(MAX_VAL)` memory)
    * IntHashSet (only ints)
    * How to hash keys
    * Hashing Passwords: Salting, Blowfish
* HashMap

## Lec 5

* LinkedList
    * Not required for efficient `select`. `select!`.
    * Not required for dequeue (can use a ring buffer)
* Ex: LRUCache

## Lec 6

* Heaps and packed representation
    * Priority queue.
* Uses: work-queue, max k items, Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## Lec7-8

* Sorting
    * MergeSort
    * QuickSort
    * HeapSort
* RAM Caching
* CPU Architecture

## Lec 9

* BSTs; self-balancing tree
    * Balancing can't go wrong.
    * No O(n) worst case
    * In-order traversal
    * Let's say you have an itinerary. At any moment, you want to know
      the next thing to do. You also want to add new itinerary items
      at any time quickly.
    * Traversal algorithms.

## And Beyond!

* Graphs
    * Different versions of time complexity
    * Topological Sort
    * BFS shortest paths
    * Dijkstra's
    * Prim's Algorithm
* Database Scalability, Transaction Processing
    * Locking, anomolies
    * MVCC, write skew
* Concurrency: threads and events
    * MapReduce

## Coursera Algorithms I
